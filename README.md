# Brief introduction

- A web page which looks simple but its principles are consistent with many functions that are very useful in production environments.
> Please click: [Personalized theme selection](https://qingjieshen.github.io/locolStorage-theme-switch/)

# How it works?
- You can get different interface of list styles and color themes by selecting Theme and List Style in the Preference pannel on the right.
- The data you select will be stored locally, and your previous selections will still be retained when you open the web page next time.

# Why we need this?
- By storing data locally, we can dynamically manage user personalized data, which can greatly improve user experience.
- For example, if a user visited a weisite and did some operations before logging in, we can use this function to save the user's data and automatically fill in relevant content after the user completes the login process. This will greatly improve user's experience.
